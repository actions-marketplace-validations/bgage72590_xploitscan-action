# XploitScan Security Scanner — GitHub Action

Scan your code for security vulnerabilities on every pull request. Built for AI-generated code from Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, Replit, and other vibe-coding tools.

- **223 security rules** (30 in the free tier, full set with an API key from any paid plan)
- **SARIF output** piped into the GitHub Security tab
- **PR comments** with a security grade and findings summary
- **Configurable fail thresholds** to block merges on critical/high findings
- **Optional AI false-positive filter** (Claude Haiku, ~$0.01 / scan) to reduce noise on CI runs

## See it in action

- **[Live demo PR →](https://github.com/bgage72590/xploitscan-demo/pull/1)** — real pull request in a deliberately-vulnerable repo. Scroll to the bottom for the `XploitScan Security Report` comment.
- **[Live Security tab →](https://github.com/bgage72590/xploitscan-demo/security/code-scanning)** — the same findings surfaced as GitHub code-scanning alerts, with one-click navigation to the offending lines.
- **[Live file-level annotations →](https://github.com/bgage72590/xploitscan-demo/pull/1/files)** — in the "Files changed" tab each finding appears inline next to the vulnerable code, powered by GitHub Advanced Security's SARIF integration.

Every new PR on the [demo repo](https://github.com/bgage72590/xploitscan-demo) is a fresh, self-refreshing example — no stale screenshot to maintain.

## Usage

Add this to `.github/workflows/xploitscan.yml`:

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: bgage72590/xploitscan-action@v1
        with:
          fail-on: critical
```

`@v1` tracks the latest v1 release. Pin the action to a full commit SHA so a moved tag cannot change what runs: `uses: bgage72590/xploitscan-action@b5db3d14ea5ca2d3d5f9f6cf59ed307a6634bc85 # v1.11.0`.

`security-events: write` is needed only for the code-scanning upload. If you set `upload-sarif: 'false'`, you can leave it out. The SARIF file is still written to `sarif-file`, for example to save as a workflow artifact.

### With an API key from any paid plan (full 223-rule set)

```yaml
      - uses: bgage72590/xploitscan-action@v1
        with:
          fail-on: high
          api-key: ${{ secrets.XPLOITSCAN_API_KEY }}
          anthropic-api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Generate an API key from any paid plan at **xploitscan.com → Settings → API Keys**. The optional AI false-positive filter needs `anthropic-api-key`; `api-key` alone unlocks the full rule set.

## Inputs

| Input | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `path` | Path to scan (default: current directory) | `.` |
| `fail-on` | Fail the action if graded findings (critical, high, medium, low — not info) of this severity or higher are found: critical, high, medium, low, none (default: none) | `none` |
| `sarif-file` | Path to write SARIF output (default: xploitscan-results.sarif) | `xploitscan-results.sarif` |
| `upload-sarif` | Upload the SARIF file to GitHub code scanning (the Security tab). Set to `false` on private repositories without GitHub Code Security; the SARIF file is still written to `sarif-file`. | `true` |
| `comment` | Post a summary comment on pull requests (default: true) | `true` |
| `api-key` | XploitScan API key (xpls_...) — generate one in Settings → API Keys. Required to unlock the full 223-rule Pro set; without it the action runs the 30 free rules. | `''` |
| `fail-on-quality` | Also fail the action on high-severity code-quality findings (QA…). Off by default: quality findings are reported either way, and the exit code is a contract with pipelines that were passing before they existed. See https://xploitscan.com/quality | `false` |
| `grade-vendored` | Count findings in vendored, generated, and documentation files (components/ui, __generated__, *.md) toward the grade and the failure threshold. Off by default — those findings are reported and uploaded to the Security tab either way. Set to true if you treat vendored code as yours to maintain. Test and fixture files stay out of the grade either way. NOTE: this input is what the action grades by; `scan.gradeVendored` in .xploitscanrc does not apply here, because the action recomputes the grade from the scan JSON rather than using the CLI's. | `false` |
| `anthropic-api-key` | Optional Anthropic API key. When set, findings are run through XploitScan's AI false-positive filter (uses Claude Haiku, ~$0.01 per scan). Reduces noise on CI runs. Get one at https://console.anthropic.com. | `''` |

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `grade` | Security grade (A+ to F) |
| `score` | Security score (0-100). At most 3 findings of any one rule are deducted. Entropy is one rule, not one per line, and dependency advisories (GHSA, CVE, OSV, DEP) are one rule as well. The severity counts below are the real totals. Letter caps use those same capped counts. |
| `findings-count` | Total number of findings, including ones not counted toward the grade |
| `graded-findings-count` | Findings that count toward the grade (excludes vendored, generated, documentation, and test files). Includes info findings, which never fail the build. |
| `ungraded-count` | Findings in vendored, generated, documentation, or test files. Reported and uploaded in the SARIF, but not counted toward the grade or the failure threshold. A live provider key in a test file is still graded and is not included here. Dependency advisories (GHSA, CVE, OSV, DEP) count as one rule toward the score, the same way entropy does. |
| `quality-count` | Code-quality findings (QA…). Never counted toward the grade or the severity counts; see fail-on-quality. |
| `quality-high-count` | Code-quality findings at high severity or above. |
| `critical-count` | Number of critical findings |
| `high-count` | Number of high findings |
| `medium-count` | Number of medium findings |
| `low-count` | Number of low findings |
| `sarif-file` | Path to the SARIF output file |

## What it does

1. Installs the exact `xploitscan` release named by `XPLOITSCAN_CLI_VERSION` in `action.yml` (one line) and runs that binary for every scan.
2. Uploads SARIF results to the GitHub Security tab (findings appear as annotations on changed files in the PR).
3. Posts a security summary comment on pull requests — updates in place on subsequent pushes so you never get comment spam.
4. Optionally fails the check if findings exceed your `fail-on` threshold.

## Example PR Comment

When code changes are detected:

> ## 🔴 XploitScan Security Report
>
> **Grade: D** | Score: 65/100 | 5 findings
>
> | Severity | Count |
> |----------|-------|
> | 🔴 Critical | 1 |
> | 🟠 High | 2 |
> | 🟡 Medium | 2 |
> | 🔵 Low | 0 |

If the CLI crashes, or the JSON report is missing, empty, or not a scan result, the job fails with an `::error::` annotation. A normal scan still passes or fails only from `fail-on` (exit 1 from the CLI means findings over its own critical/high threshold, not a crash).

## Supported languages

XploitScan's 223-rule set primarily targets **JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js** codebases — that's where the rules are deepest (secrets, SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, prototype pollution, crypto misuse, unsafe deserialization, and more). Additional rule coverage extends to Python, Go, and a handful of configuration surfaces (Dockerfile, Terraform, Kubernetes manifests, CI workflows, `.env` files, package manifests) where patterns are transferable.

If you run a polyglot repo, the action will still scan and skip files it doesn't have rules for — you get signal on the supported surfaces without noise elsewhere.

## Pinning the action version

`@v1` tracks the latest v1 release, and a tag can be moved. Pin the action to a full commit SHA:

```yaml
- uses: bgage72590/xploitscan-action@v1 # floating v1
- uses: bgage72590/xploitscan-action@b5db3d14ea5ca2d3d5f9f6cf59ed307a6634bc85 # v1.11.0
```
